## Our project 

The
![](/images/Workflow4Metabolomic_icon.svg){height=1em}, ![](/images/W4M_icon.svg){height=1em} in short, is a French infrastructure offering software tool processing, analyzing and annotating metabolomics data. It is based on the Galaxy platform.

In a collaborative efforts between metabolomics (

) and bioinformatics platforms (
[![](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/wp-content/uploads/logo-ifb-couleur.svg){height=1.5em}](https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/) Institut Fran√ßais de Bioinformatique
), we've crafted comprehensive LC/MS, GC/MS, and NMR pipelines using the robust
[![](https://galaxyproject.org/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy_logo_25percent.png){height=1em}](https://galaxyproject.org/)
framework.
Our **pipelines** cover the entire spectrum of data analysis, encompassing **preprocessing**, **normalization**, **quality control**, **statistical analysis**, and **annotation** steps.

These modular and adaptable workflows are carefully assembled with a combination of established components (such as
[XCMS](https://github.com/sneumann/xcms)
and
[CAMERA](https://github.com/sneumann/CAMERA)
packages) and a suite of tools developed by the ![](/images/W4M_icon.svg){height=1em} team members. Our implementation, accessible through a user-friendly web interface, ensures the completeness of parameter settings and reproducibility. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of 
[![](https://galaxyproject.org/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy_logo_25percent.png){height=1em}](https://galaxyproject.org/)
, we seamlessly integrate components from diverse sources and types.

This integration has facilitated the creation of an extensible Virtual Research Environment (VRE) tailored for metabolomics communities, including platforms and end-users. Our VRE offers preconfigured workflows for newcomers while catering to experts in the field. This collaborative approach not only ensures accessibility but also encourages knowledge-sharing and enhances the overall research experience.


## Galaxy

[![](https://galaxyproject.org/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy_logo_25percent.png){height=1em}](https://galaxyproject.org/) is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research. Whether on the free public server or your own instance, you can perform, reproduce, and share complete analyses.
