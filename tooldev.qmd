## Developing Galaxy tools in general

In case you are not familiar with Galaxy tool development, there is plenty of supports to help you beginning and improving.

Don't know where to start? There are 
[very cool and easy-to-handle tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/#st-tooldev)
hosted by the Galaxy Training Network. You can also have a look at the
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/workflow4metabolomics/blob/master/GUIDELINES.md#writing-a-tool)
we wrote for our W4M contributors and collaborators. 

Please note that W4M also hosts a GitHub repository aiming to gather tools and contributors from the metabolomics world.
