## Developing Galaxy tools in general

In case you are not familiar with Galaxy tool development, there is plenty of supports to help you beginning and improving.

Don't know where to start? There are 
[very cool and easy-to-handle tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/#st-tooldev)
hosted by the Galaxy Training Network. You can also have a look at the
[contribution guidelines](https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/workflow4metabolomics/blob/master/GUIDELINES.md#writing-a-tool)
we wrote for our W4M contributors and collaborators. 

Please note that W4M also hosts a GitHub repository aiming to gather tools and contributors from the metabolomics world. 
[More information available in the associated Readme](https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/tools-metabolomics)

## Developing tools compatible with W4M input/output datasets

Due to the diversity of tools needed to construct comprehensive metabolomic workflows, W4M chose to adopt common standards across its tools, in particular regarding data table formats.

### About the W4M standardised 3-tables format

As W4M provides a large variety of tools, we set a common way to handle data, in order to
enable easy links between the tools, limiting format switches 
and ensuring users can easily find the information they seek inside their data sets. 

For any extracted data (*i.e.* a single intensity value per {analytical variable; sample} pair), 
we settled for a standardised 3-tables format, in the form of 'tabular' files 
(as defined in Galaxy, *i.e.* plain text files (.txt, .tsv, .tabular) containing tables with columns separated by tabulations).
One file is dedicated to the intensity values measured for each analytical variable and each sample,
a second file gathers the meta-data concerning the samples,
and a third file is about the meta-data of the analytical variables.

Detailed information about this W4M 3-tables format is [available here](https://nextcloud.inrae.fr/s/qLkNZRf84QQ5YLY). 

Familiar with [Biobase formating](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biobase.html) from Bioconductor? 
The W4M 3-tables format is very similar to the ExpressionSets organisation of data, 
the main difference being that the dataMatrix table is a transposition of the assay data table:

| W4M format       | ExpressionSets                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| dataMatrix       | *transposed* assay data (assayData)       |
| sampleMetadata   | phenotypic data (phenoData)               |
| variableMetadata | annotations and feature data (annotation) |

## Developing tools in a W4M-approuved format

**TODO** blabla intro

### The tool being wrapped

**TODO** topo sur le user experience

**TODO** Ajout de la ref Ã  [W4MRUtils](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/W4MRUtils/index.html) dans le cas de codes en R.


### The Galaxy XML wrapper

Among the possible variations for functional XML wrappers, W4M is willing to garantee [...]

**TODO** les reco W4M du XML

### Documenting the Galaxy tool

**TODO** Topo sur l'importance de la doc

**TODO** Presenter les section mandatory et facultative

About the format, you can find [here](ressources/Help_template.txt)
a template of Help tag to help you initiating your writing with the recommanded sections and formats.
