I am a research engineer on the metabolism platform exploration (PFEM). I am in charge of environmental project management. We are interested in the metabolic adaptations of microorganism’s communities in different ecosystems. I contribute to the development of experimental design for metabolomics studies and I am responsible for the statistical analysis and biological interpretation of results. For that, I work in the networking of metabolic/protein biomarkers in relation to the research problematic.

## Education
